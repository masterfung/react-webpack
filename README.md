#React Projects
#### April 2015
#### Elaborated by: Tsung Hung

A list of wonderful react projects that will grow over time.

All of the projects uses ES6 and Babel.

##Current Projects
- Todo App
- Simple Hello World
- Playing with Babel
- Spotify clone using EchoNest (on-going)
- Friend Adder (called Wondy.es6)

##Procedure

`npm install`
`npm start`
`gulp dev`

When working with any particular .es6 file, please switch the filename in the gulpfile.js to reflect the right file or else it will not work. You will have to restart the process using `gulp dev`

##Feedback & Questions
Please let me know if you have any questions or feedback. I will continue to expand on this project.
